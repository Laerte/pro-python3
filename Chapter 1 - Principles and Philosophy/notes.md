# The Zen of Python

- Beautiful Is Better Than Ugly
> Python’s own language structure minimizes the use of punctuation, preferring English words where appropriate
- Explicit Is Better Than Implicit
> Python asks you to declare your intentions explicitly rather than issue every command necessary to make that intention a reality.
- Simple Is Better Than Complex
> By relying on simpler interfaces, you can often take advantage of optimizations and increased flexibility while producing more readable code.
- Complex Is Better Than Complicated
    - *Complex*: Made up of many interconnected parts
    - *Complicated*: So complex as to be difficult to understand
> Sometimes, a certain level of complexity is required in order to get the job done. Grouping objects into more logical arrangements or even simply making sure to use names that make sense without having to dig into the code to understand them. Complexity doesn’t necessarily require it to be complicated.
- Flat Is Better Than Nested
> It’s about how structures are laid out, the goal is to keep things as relationships of peers as much possible, rather than parents and children
- Sparse Is Better Than Dense
> This principle largely pertains to the visual appearance of Python source code, favoring the use of whitespace to differentiate among blocks of code.
- Readability Counts
> Readability is all about actively promoting human understanding of code.
- Special Cases Aren’t Special Enough to Break the Rules
> The conviction to stand behind the decisions you’ve made.
- Practicality Beats Purity
> Allow exceptions whenever the right thing gets difficult. Typically, it’s preferable to maintain greater overall consistency at the expense of a few small areas that may be less than ideal.
- Errors Should Never Pass Silently
> Every time we write a piece of code, we make a promise that it will work in a specific way. Exceptions break that promise, so we need to understand what types of promises we make and how they can be broken.
- Unless Explicitly Silenced
> Validation errors should be shown to the user in a nicer way than a full traceback.
- In the Face of Ambiguity, Refuse the Temptation to Guess
- There Should Be One—and Preferably Only One—Obvious Way to Do It
>  It’s okay to provide multiple ways to do something as long as they’re for sufficiently different use cases, and the most common use case is presented as the obvious choice.
- Although That Way May Not Be Obvious at First, Unless You’re Dutch
> What seems obvious to one person might seem completely foreign to somebody else
- Now Is Better Than Never
> The best time to do it is when it’s on our mind.
- Although Never Is Often Better Than Right Now
> Taking the time to refine and clarify an idea is essential to getting it right, and failing to do so usually produces code that could be described as—at best—mediocre.
- If the Implementation Is Hard to Explain, It’s a Bad Idea
- If the Implementation Is Easy to Explain, It May Be a  Good Idea
- Namespaces Are One Honking Great Idea: Let’s Do More of Those!
- Don’t Repeat Yourself
> It’s often better to move that common code out into a separate utility function. 
- Loose Coupling
- The Samurai Principle
- The Pareto Principle
> The vast majority of effects in many systems are a result of just a small number of the causes.
- The Robustness Principle
- Backward Compatibility
