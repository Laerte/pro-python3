# The Zen of Python

- Beautiful Is Better Than Ugly
> Python’s own language structure minimizes the use of punctuation, preferring English words where appropriate
- Explicit Is Better Than Implicit
> Python asks you to declare your intentions explicitly rather than issue every command necessary to make that intention a reality.
- Simple Is Better Than Complex
> By relying on simpler interfaces, you can often take advantage of optimizations and increased flexibility while producing more readable code.
- Complex Is Better Than Complicated
    - *Complex*: Made up of many interconnected parts
    - *Complicated*: So complex as to be difficult to understand
> Sometimes, a certain level of complexity is required in order to get the job done. Grouping objects into more logical arrangements or even simply making sure to use names that make sense without having to dig into the code to understand them. Complexity doesn’t necessarily require it to be complicated.
- Flat Is Better Than Nested
> It’s about how structures are laid out, the goal is to keep things as relationships of peers as much possible, rather than parents and children
